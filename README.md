# Overview
This is a simple introductory project to begin learning Vulkan.
I will start by following the "Drawing a Triangle" tutorial from https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Introduction

Ultimately, I hope to aggregate knowlege on Vulkan and other modern graphics APIs here and then branch off to build a fully-custom rendering engine with which I can implement real-time PBR techniques from SIGGRAPH papers. I may also port over some GLSL/shader projects I previously implemented using OpenGL. 

# Tools and Libraries
I am using Visual Studio 2022, and per the tutorial I am also using the latest versions - as of October 2023 - of GLM (linear algebra library) and GLFW (windowing library)

LunarG Vulkan SDK version: 1.3.261.1
GLFW version: 3.3.8
GLM version: 0.9.9 (2020-04-13)
